This repository contains code that will help Frontend developers with the following things:

1) Connect Solana wallet to the blockchain (Phantom, Sollet and others)

2) Send SOL from connected wallet

3) Send SPL tokens (USDC for example) from the connected wallet

If you want me to add any other features related to Solana, write to me by mail evgenii.stepanishin@gmail.com

Happy coding!
